Full stack developer, creating for the web. Strong emphasis on Python, Perl, DevOps, security, optimization, deploying to ---and scaling with--- the cloud, empathic design and UI/UX. Entrepreneur.

### Colophon

I won't bore you with a detailed outline of all the tools and technologies used in creating, managing and delivering this site to you. What's most important is that everything is open source and available to anyone at zero cost. You can replicate my setup starting here: [Vagrant, Jekyll and Github Pages for streamlined content creation](http://kappataumu.com/articles/vagrant-jekyll-github-pages-streamlined-content-creation.html).
